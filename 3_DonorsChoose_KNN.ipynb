      "I have been fortunate enough to use the Fairy Tale STEM kits in my classroom as well as the STEM journals, which my students really enjoyed.  I would love to implement more of the Lakeshore STEM kits in my classroom for the next school year as they provide excellent and engaging STEM lessons.My students come from a variety of backgrounds, including language and socioeconomic status.  Many of them don't have a lot of experience in science and engineering and these kits give me the materials to provide these exciting opportunities for my students.Each month I try to do several science or STEM/STEAM projects.  I would use the kits and robot to help guide my science instruction in engaging and meaningful ways.  I can adapt the kits to my current language arts pacing guide where we already teach some of the material in the kits like tall tales (Paul Bunyan) or Johnny Appleseed.  The following units will be taught in the next school year where I will implement these kits: magnets, motion, sink vs. float, robots.  I often get to these units and don't know If I am teaching the right way or using the right materials.    The kits will give me additional ideas, strategies, and lessons to prepare my students in science.It is challenging to develop high quality science activities.  These kits give me the materials I need to provide my students with science activities that will go along with the curriculum in my classroom.  Although I have some things (like magnets) in my classroom, I don't know how to use them effectively.  The kits will provide me with the right amount of materials and show me how to use them in an appropriate way.\n",

      "I teach high school English to students with learning and behavioral disabilities. My students all vary in their ability level. However, the ultimate goal is to increase all students literacy levels. This includes their reading, writing, and communication levels.I teach a really dynamic group of students. However, my students face a lot of challenges. My students all live in poverty and in a dangerous neighborhood. Despite these challenges, I have students who have the the desire to defeat these challenges. My students all have learning disabilities and currently all are performing below grade level. My students are visual learners and will benefit from a classroom that fulfills their preferred learning style.The materials I am requesting will allow my students to be prepared for the classroom with the necessary supplies.  Too often I am challenged with students who come to school unprepared for class due to economic challenges.  I want my students to be able to focus on learning and not how they will be able to get school supplies.  The supplies will last all year.  Students will be able to complete written assignments and maintain a classroom journal.  The chart paper will be used to make learning more visual in class and to create posters to aid students in their learning.  The students have access to a classroom printer.  The toner will be used to print student work that is completed on the classroom Chromebooks.I want to try and remove all barriers for the students learning and create opportunities for learning. One of the biggest barriers is the students not having the resources to get pens, paper, and folders. My students will be able to increase their literacy skills because of this project.\n",

      "\\\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\\\"  from the movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Think back...what do you remember about your grandparents?  How amazing would it be to be able to flip through a book to see a day in their lives?My second graders are voracious readers! They love to read both fiction and nonfiction books.  Their favorite characters include Pete the Cat, Fly Guy, Piggie and Elephant, and Mercy Watson. They also love to read about insects, space and plants. My students are hungry bookworms! My students are eager to learn and read about the world around them. My kids love to be at school and are like little sponges absorbing everything around them. Their parents work long hours and usually do not see their children. My students are usually cared for by their grandparents or a family friend. Most of my students do not have someone who speaks English at home. Thus it is difficult for my students to acquire language.Now think forward... wouldn't it mean a lot to your kids, nieces or nephews or grandchildren, to be able to see a day in your life today 30 years from now? Memories are so precious to us and being able to share these memories with future generations will be a rewarding experience.  As part of our social studies curriculum, students will be learning about changes over time.  Students will be studying photos to learn about how their community has changed over time.  In particular, we will look at photos to study how the land, buildings, clothing, and schools have changed over time.  As a culminating activity, my students will capture a slice of their history and preserve it through scrap booking. Key important events in their young lives will be documented with the date, location, and names.   Students will be using photos from home and from school to create their second grade memories.   Their scrap books will preserve their unique stories for future generations to enjoy.Your donation to this project will provide my second graders with an opportunity to learn about social studies in a fun and creative manner.  Through their scrapbooks, children will share their story with others and have a historical document for the rest of their lives.\n",

      "My classroom consists of twenty-two amazing sixth graders from different cultures and backgrounds. They are a social bunch who enjoy working in partners and working with groups. They are hard-working and eager to head to middle school next year. My job is to get them ready to make this transition and make it as smooth as possible. In order to do this, my students need to come to school every day and feel safe and ready to learn. Because they are getting ready to head to middle school, I give them lots of choice- choice on where to sit and work, the order to complete assignments, choice of projects, etc. Part of the students feeling safe is the ability for them to come into a welcoming, encouraging environment. My room is colorful and the atmosphere is casual. I want them to take ownership of the classroom because we ALL share it together. Because my time with them is limited, I want to ensure they get the most of this time and enjoy it to the best of their abilities.Currently, we have twenty-two desks of differing sizes, yet the desks are similar to the ones the students will use in middle school. We also have a kidney table with crates for seating. I allow my students to choose their own spots while they are working independently or in groups. More often than not, most of them move out of their desks and onto the crates. Believe it or not, this has proven to be more successful than making them stay at their desks! It is because of this that I am looking toward the “Flexible Seating” option for my classroom.\\r\\n The students look forward to their work time so they can move around the room. I would like to get rid of the constricting desks and move toward more “fun” seating options. I am requesting various seating so my students have more options to sit. Currently, I have a stool and a papasan chair I inherited from the previous sixth-grade teacher as well as five milk crate seats I made, but I would like to give them more options and reduce the competition for the “good seats”. I am also requesting two rugs as not only more seating options but to make the classroom more welcoming and appealing. In order for my students to be able to write and complete work without desks, I am requesting a class set of clipboards. Finally, due to curriculum that requires groups to work together, I am requesting tables that we can fold up when we are not using them to leave more room for our flexible seating options.\\r\\nI know that with more seating options, they will be that much more excited about coming to school! Thank you for your support in making my classroom one students will remember forever!nannan\n",
